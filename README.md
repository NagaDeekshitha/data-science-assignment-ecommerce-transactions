# Data Science Assignment: eCommerce Transactions Dataset

## Overview
This repository contains the solution for the **Data Science Assignment** involving an **eCommerce Transactions Dataset**. The assignment focuses on three main tasks:

- **Task 1**: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Business Insights
- **Task 2**: Lookalike Model
- **Task 3**: Customer Segmentation / Clustering

## Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Business Insights
- **Objective**: Perform an EDA on the provided dataset and generate business insights.
- **Steps**: Data cleaning, feature exploration, and visualization.
- **Deliverable**: A PDF report containing 5 business insights derived from the data.

## Task 2: Lookalike Model
- **Objective**: Build a model that recommends 3 similar customers based on their profile and transaction history.
- **Steps**: Use customer and product information to calculate similarity scores.
- **Deliverable**: A CSV file containing the top 3 lookalikes for the first 20 customers along with similarity scores.

## Task 3: Customer Segmentation / Clustering
- **Objective**: Segment customers based on their profiles and transaction history using clustering techniques.
- **Steps**: Perform clustering using K-Means and evaluate the model with the Davies-Bouldin Index.
- **Deliverable**: A PDF report containing clustering results, including the number of clusters, DB Index, and visualizations.
